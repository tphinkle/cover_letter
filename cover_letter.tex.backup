% General guidelines for cover letters:
%
% 0. The cover letter must fit on a single page. 
%
% 1. If the resume is the interview, the cover letter is the
% pre-interview hand shake and introduction. Keep it brief, but personal. 
% Highlight the things about yourself that you want your PI to know, but don't
% brag. Skip the flattery. Be sincere.
% 
% 2. You can gamble with a flashy cover letter that will stand out, or have a
% more plain, professional looking one. Whatever your design choices, your
% cover letter must be easy to read, with a clean look.
% 
% 3. The cover letter consists of four sections:
% 	I. Introduction
% 	II. Your unique qualifications for the position
% 	III. Your most proud accomplishments that are relative to the position
%	IV. Closing

\noindent Dear [PI],
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\noindent\textbf{1. Introductory paragraph}

The first sentence should be a short, formal declaration of your intent to apply for the job opening/in the PI's lab, e.g. 'I am applying for the open postdoctoral position in your laboratory that was posted at [insert job posting location/website].' Next comes basic information about yourself, such as current position (e.g. graduate student), current place of work, PI/mentor/boss, and the date you are available. 'I am a PhD student in physics working in the lab of Dr. Advisor at Such-and-Such University. I am looking for employment immediately following my expected graduation in June this upcoming year.
\vspace{\baselineskip}


\noindent\textbf{2. What you expect to give to and gain from the position}

A sentence.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\noindent\textbf{3. Accomplishments}

In this paragraph, you want to highlight your academic achievements. These include papers written, projects you've worked on that you're particularly proud of, fellowships, awards, etc. The idea is to convince the prospective PI that you have a solid history of putting out good work, and that that history will translate into future success.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\noindent\textbf{4. Closing}

Close the letter by courteously thanking the PI for her/his consideration, and that you look forward to hearing from her/him.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\noindent Sincerely,

[Optional slick signature]

\noindent [Your name]
